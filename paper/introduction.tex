While the number of cars in our roads is expected to evolve with the population, the methodology of traffic control has not evolved. While it is true that the number and quality of sensors increase every day, they still yield a margin of speed rather than a fixed speed. Besides, their nature only allows them to give instant speed measurements that can (and are) easily fooled by drivers. On top of that, the systems usually trigger when a speeding car approaches, closing the door to more elaborate systems.

In order to fix these disadvantages, we present a tracking system that is able to extract information on real time from all the passing vehicles. This information could be used as a cornerstone of complex systems such as intelligent traffic, accident detection, license plate recognition, or calculating time between locations.

This article starts with the study of the related work at section \ref{sec:relatedwork}, the pipeline description on section \ref{sec:pipeline}, followed by a more deep explanation of our algorithms at sections \textit{Foreground substraction},\textit{Morphology operations},\textit{Tracking and speed estimation} and \textit{Estabilization}. We present results at section \sec{sec:results}.
