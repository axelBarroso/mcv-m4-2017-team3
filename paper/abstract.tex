We propose a method for real time tracking and motion estimation for traffic environments.
Combining stabilization techniques,background modeling, morphology filters and a very
 simple Kalman Filter we are able to reliably detect moving cars on a highway and obtain
an estimation of their speed. We present our code in Python.
